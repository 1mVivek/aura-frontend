# API Configuration
# WARNING: API keys should NEVER be exposed in the frontend!
# This is a security vulnerability. The API key will be embedded in the client-side bundle
# and visible to anyone who inspects the JavaScript files.
# 
# RECOMMENDED: Implement a backend proxy that adds the API key server-side.
# The frontend should call your own backend endpoint, which then adds the API key
# when making requests to the third-party API.
